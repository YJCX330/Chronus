We almost got featured on YouTube's homepage. So let's see if we can get us there. And I've actually traveled to Japan and many other awesome places around the world. If you guys want to see my Japan traveling vlogs, you guys can click right over here. Amazing experience. The food is amazing and the people are just so humble and nice. Alright, so we all know that every country has their own weird laws, and Japan is no exception. So let's take a look at the top 10 insane laws in Japan. Starting us off at number 10 with the dancing in nightclubs. Seems sort of ironic, doesn't it? But yes, dancing in certain nightclubs is illegal in Tokyo. The law has been around since 1948, and clubs that are less than 700 feet or don't have a dancing permit can actually face some pretty harsh fines for people dancing. And despite what you might think, clubs that don't actually meet the proper criteria actually enforce this dancing law and you can easily get kicked out for dancing. Obtaining a blowfish license comes in at number nine. You need to obtain a license or a certificate before being able to handle a blowfish. And it isn't an easy task. Chefs who have undergone at least two years of training at a pufferfish restaurant are entitled to take certification tests in order to be able to cook it. They must pass extremely difficult practical and written exams. The emperor is also banned from eating it, just in case he gets a poisonous bite. Being fat comes onto this list at number eight. Japan's pretty rude. Since 2008, it is illegal to be fat in Japan under the Metabo Law. The maximum waistline is 33.5 inches for men over the age of 40 and 35.4 inches for women. But instead of jail time, these people who exceed the limit will be given a strict diet and they must adhere to it for several months. This Metabo Law aims to save the country money by preventing illnesses rather than spending money to treat them. And now at number seven is brewing your own alcohol. Home brewing anything over 1% is illegal in Japan and the penalties involve up to five years in prison and or a $5,000 in fines. I don't see the point of buying all of this expensive brewing equipment if you can't even make anything over 1%. I'm sure that there's a lot of people brewing their own wine and beer at home that is most likely over the 1% limit, but they are keeping it, you know, on the down low. It is forbidden to damage or throw money away, and this comes into number six. Why are people throwing money away? Why does this have to be a law? If you are caught doing this, you could be fi-\" >",

The drilling the holes anywhere in the waste area is acceptable. Honestly, it does not matter where you would drill a hole because it's all waste anyway, but personally, I like to go towards the corner areas, the sharp corners such as here. This is where I already drilled a hole and I would make my first cut going this way and working around.

Going this way and if this was the rounded area on bottom, follow these if all these areas right here were curved such as this, I would put my starter hole down here on the bottom. Same reason. It's easier to to deceive the eye. But like I said, put your starter hole closest to a sharp point. It could be right here towards this tail, could be right here in this corner, it could be in this corner. It could this isn't really a sharp point.

A man speaks, \"Hey, what's up everyone? I'm Ronnie Woo, and this is cooking for you and me. For this week's tip, I'm going to show you guys how to break down and clean a soft-shell crab. Soft-shell crabs are simply blue crabs that have just molted and they're still soft. The season runs from about April to September. And I know that they come whole at the fish markets and this might scare you, but don't be scared. Their preparation is super simple and they're super delicious. So check it out.\" The music transitions to a rock-oriented track as he continues, \"So the first thing you want to do is cut off the eyes and the mouth. They tend to be bitter and it's just an overall better presentation. Besides, no one wants to eat a face.\" A cutting sound is heard. \"Then you want to flip it over and cut off the abdomen flap.\" Another cutting sound is heard. \"Then you want to flip it back over and lift the shell on each side, find the gills, and cut them off. You can either remove the guts or leave them in. If you're going to remove the guts, gently squeeze the crab and pull them out. Many people actually leave this part of the crab in because it offers a rich, decadent flavor. So I'm going to do one with and one without.\" Over the music, he says, \"And you're done. And that is how you break down and clean a soft-shell crab. If you guys haven't done so already, do yourself a favor and go out and grab some soft-shell crabs before the season's over. I'll see you guys next time on Cooking for You and Me with Ronnie Woo.\" The music changes to a jazzy tune. The man says, \"In a flat dish, add about a quarter cup of flour, one teaspoon of garlic powder.\" >"

All you can do is hold the home and the power button in until it reboots and that may fix it right there. And if rebooting doesn't work, another thing you can try is putting your device into DFU or recovery mode.

You pretty much do the same thing with holding the home and power buttons in, it's just like a different process of doing it and then you can restore your device in iTunes. That's just if you have issues, any problems, which most of you guys probably won't. Alright, so there you go. Hopefully you guys enjoyed this.

If you want to, I'll put a link down below to my video I did on iOS 8 to like show you all the new features in it or if you're considering whether you should upgrade to this yet, you can go check that out to give you an idea. If you guys haven't done so, make sure you go ahead and subscribe to my YouTube channel right there so you don't miss any of my future videos. Once the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus comes out, I'm be getting both of those, doing tons of videos on it for you guys, plus probably some videos on iOS 8, who knows.

And then you'll see I've got kind of like a little chocolate drip tray here. So you want to give it a couple of really hefty shakes,\" followed by a shaking sound. The woman continues, \"which is going to smooth the chocolate out. It's going to drain off any excess, and it's going to force it down into that little center mold. Use your finger just to rim around the edges to make it really, really nice and neat. And it kind of makes your saucers shiny and clean like actual crockery. Once your cookie shots have completed baking, let them sit in their tray for 5 minutes before trying to pull them out. So these are still quite warm, but letting them sit just allows them to sweat a little bit and makes them easier to remove. You can see I'm just gently placing my thumb in and I'm just pulling them out. They are sliding out really, really easily. With everything out now and cooled, I'm going to quickly show you how to make those spoons. So a spoon mold is not something that everyone is going to have, but it is a fairly commonly available chocolate mold. I'm just drizzling in some of that melted white chocolate, being careful not to get too much of it up around the outside edges of the mold. And then we're going to make sure that we give it a couple of really, really good taps on the bench,\" followed by a tapping sound. She continues, \"and that's just going to force that chocolate right down into all the grooves of the spoons. Pop those off into the fridge, let them set, and your white chocolate spoons are done. Now it's important here that you line your cookie shots, or else that milk is going to soak into the cookie and it's all going to seep out onto the bench and make a huge mess. So two teaspoons of white chocolate straight into the bottom of that cookie shot, and then you just want to turn it. You want that white chocolate to completely coat the inside, and I also made sure that mine came all the way up over the outer lip of my cookie shot glass. Make sure that you're shaking out as much of the excess as you can, while still being sure that the entire inside is covered. If you happen to see any cookie poking through that white chocolate, cover it up with a tiny little bit more white chocolate, because that's where your cookie shot's going to leak. While that white chocolate's still fresh and wet, just flatten down your Oreo crumbs in that bowl and just dip the very, very top of your cookie shot in, so you get all of those beautiful Oreo crumbs kind of around the rim and around the edge. Make sure you repeat this process with all of your Oreo cookie shots, and I cannot stress enough how important it is to make sure that that inside is completely coated so that they are watertight. When your spoons come out of the fridge all nice and set, it's as simple as popping them out. Look how cute they are. If you just run your fingers down the side of them, you'll just be able to knock off any little excess or messy ridges on your spoons. Pop those off onto your little cookie saucers. To fill your Oreo shots, it is as simple as taking a little bit of milk. You can also make an Oreo milkshake here. And I'm going to finish mine off like I said with a little bit of canned whipped cream. I did a bit of a test on our Oreo cookie shots to see how long they would remain watertight for. This display one that I've got in the corner of the screen has been like that for about 4 hours. So I am happy that they are completely watertight and they're not going to leak. A little bit of that whipped cream on top, a sprinkling of crushed Oreos to decorate. There you've got a fully edible saucer, a delicious white chocolate spoon, and a stunningly decadent Oreo cookie shot. I hope you guys have loved this idea. I hope you've loved my take on this new sweet trend phenomenon. If you love it, make sure you share it so others can enjoy it as well. And as always, thanks very much for tuning in to My Cupcake Addiction.\" Light, upbeat music plays. >",

But things began to heat up with 42's very solid ticket sales, and The Great Gatsby made headlines just two weeks ago as it surged past expectations. And now with Man of Steel, Pacific Rim, and The Conjuring on the horizon, the studio is hoping to keep the momentum going with one of its most reliable franchises, The Hangover. 2009's sleeper hit and its sequel have become the top-grossing R-rated comedies of all time, a success which has enabled its three stars to demand 15 million each for this third and supposedly final film. That's three times what they each got for the sequel, and once again they'll also be getting a piece of the film's box office haul as well. But such sky-high salaries are not only indicative of The Hangover's success, but of how the current free-agent culture of Hollywood allows talent agencies to bundle talent, in this case CAA, and hold said franchise hostage until the studio caves to their demands. In the old days, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis would all be under contract, or if they had different agents, perhaps one could be persuaded to cave. One has to wonder, though, what Ken Jeong is getting paid, as he's arguably The Hangover's secret weapon. Not a secret to producers, though, as his role has been expanded for this third outing. Justin Bartha, Mike Epps, and Heather Graham also return, as well as the baby from the first flick, all growns up. Meanwhile, John Goodman and Melissa McCarthy are joining the party. But while Warner Brothers has confidence in this franchise, Universal isn't scared. They're releasing the latest entry of their own franchise juggernaut, Fast & Furious, opposite The Hangover Part III, whereas in the past, The Hangover only had to contend with Land of the Lost and then Kung Fu Panda 2. As a result, Hollywood is expecting a slightly lower opening for The Hangover Part III than the Wolfpack's last trip to the box office. Indeed, Bradley Cooper already seems to be moving on to the next stage of his career, serious actor, while Ed Helms is set to take over for Chevy Chase in the rebooted Vacation franchise.

So in this video I want to go through a few methods of decluttering that you might find useful. Some of these are fun ways to declutter, kind of like games, and some of these are more like an overhaul your life declutter approach. So one way to approach it is to use the minimalism game. So this was actually originated from the minimalist, which I will link in the description below. So find a friend who wants to simplify their life alongside you and recruit them for a period of 30 days. So on the first day you get rid of one item. It could be something as small as like a toothbrush that you should have thrown out a long time ago. That's a bit gross. On the second day it's two items, so two product manuals that you haven't referred to in five years, and so on and so forth. No matter what, these items need to be out of your home by midnight. So if you're someone who thrives on accountability and maybe you're kind of competitive, this is an awesome way to start decluttering your life. The second way that you can approach it is the five item rule. So as you're cleaning out your bathroom cupboards, get rid of five moisturizers and scrubs that you haven't touched. As you are cleaning your kitchen, get rid of the five takeaway containers that you don't use.\" >",

Next, I'm going to add a moisturizing conditioner and I'm just using Aussie Moist to just replenish that moisture and the softness to my hair, as well as just make sure my hair smells great when I rinse it out. I'm going to smooth that through my hair for about 30 seconds and then rinse it out with cold water. So again, you're just going to rinse out your DIY protein conditioner and make sure you rinse it out with cool water to avoid cooking the egg. Follow up with your favorite moisturizing conditioner to restore the moisture and just get it smelling great again. Smooth it through for about 30 seconds and rinse that out as well with cool water. Twist up each section and then move on to the next one. And next, just make sure you enjoy your amazingly soft, shiny, stronger hair. Thanks so much for watching. Bye, pretties.\" >"

This rug was cleaned with detergents made for this fiber, rinsed completely off, and laid flat on this floor, which you can see it's plywood floor here. And because it's a Chinese needlepoint rug, this rug to maintain its shape had to be tacked out. Well that's what that means is along the whole perimeter, the left, right, front, and bottom sides, all had to be tacked out on this plywood to maintain maintain its shape while it dries. You can see in the far left corner and the far right corner, machines that are made to dry it and here in the front you can see some commercial drying machines to rapidly dry this rug to make sure there is no loss of integrity in the coloring, especially those deep rich reds that you can see on the rug, those floral designs, and also to help it maintain its shape. So if you have a rug like this, feel free to give us a call again here in the Boston area, 781-995-0683.

I'm going to take this connector off on the one I just took off the uh back of the caravan, the speaker, and I'm going to put this connector on the high performance one. So, all you need is a soldering gun, a little bit of solder, and you can do this. And it also helps to have a little pair of needle-nose pliers. Makes it a lot easier. So let me go ahead and switch this around and we'll look at it.\" A metallic clattering sound is heard. The man then says, \"All right, now I got my connectors pretty much soldered. Here's the speaker I'm going to be using, there's the old connector. I uh unsoldered it. And here's the one I need to use. I'm going to simply just kind of stick this back on here like this, push it on there. It's on. Now all I got to do is solder those little wires back on each side of that speaker, and this speaker is ready to go in. Now, um if you do just have to uh change speakers and you get an identical speaker, the connectors are the same. You don't, you don't, you don't have to go through this process. I'm just doing it because I don't want to have to spend $40 on the same identical speakers with the same connectors. So, uh you might want to research this, this might work for you. If you have to do this or if you want to use high performance speakers and if you have the connector, uh the support bracket.\" >"

Next, all you do is just tie it around the spice container and I am just giving it a quick little tie. I will be using hot glue later to secure it. I am so in love with the finished product. It looks so adorable. So, one of my must-have spices is definitely garlic powder. I put garlic powder in every single thing I cook. I absolutely love garlic powder. And I also love using basil. That's another one that I love. I just love the way it smells and it's just yummy. And I also love oregano. Just the smell of this alone is just, oh my gosh. I love putting oregano and basil on salads. It's the perfect kick of spice that a salad would need. Recently, I've really been into red peppers. I love the spice in my food. And of course, you need some sea salt. That's and of course, I make a mess every single time I pour stuff.\" The sound of pouring granular material is heard. She goes on, \"Now, I found this bad boy when I went to college. Creole seasoning is the best seasoning ever. I put this on everything, every single thing. I love the spice, it's so delicious. Next is some seasoned salt. I like having this at hand. I like putting this on my chicken. So I definitely use this every time I make chicken or any type of recipe with chicken.\" >"

So what I did was I turned it upside down. What that will do is that will heat the ring long enough to seal the jar. Now, if you can look real closely, you can already tell that this is gonna thicken up nicely. Do you see the bubbles? Those are bubbles that came up from the bottom. And look at the top. You can see the bubble. That bad boy is gelling already and it is steaming hot. So, if you don't water bath, you're not gonna have me telling you that you're gonna get sick on jellies. Did it for many, many years. I prefer to water bath can them because they stay fresher longer on your shelf. You don't have to worry about the wax melting, you don't have to worry about the lid popping, but we'll just open that jar first. If I get gutsy enough to try it. My hands are burning so bad, I'm afraid what it's gonna do to my stomach. You know, I even tried sticking my hands in a bowl of milk. Nah, doesn't work. So please protect your hands when you do this through the entire process until you get them in jars, keep those hands protected. Well, I hope you enjoy and I hope you learn something and I hope you give this a shot. Because it really is very good jelly. It does not taste like jalapeno peppers.

Well, of course, back in our day, you scraped that mold off and you kept on eating. Never got sick. So I have one jar here that didn't get water bath canned. So what I did was I turned it upside down. What that will do is that will heat the ring long enough to seal the jar. Now, if you can look real closely, you can already tell that this is gonna thicken up nicely. Do you see the bubbles? Those are bubbles that came up from the bottom. And look at the top. You can see the bubble. That bad boy is gelling already and it is steaming hot. So, if you don't water bath, you're not gonna have me telling you that you're gonna get sick on jellies. Did it for many, many years. I prefer to water bath can them because they stay fresher longer on your shelf. You don't have to worry about the wax melting, you don't have to worry about the lid popping, but we'll just open that jar first. If I get gutsy enough to try it. My hands are burning so bad, I'm afraid what it's gonna do to my stomach. You know, I even tried sticking my hands in a bowl of milk. Nah, doesn't work. So please protect your hands when you do this through the entire process until you get them in jars, keep those hands protected. Well, I hope you enjoy and I hope you learn something and I hope you give this a shot. Because it really is very good jelly. It does not taste like jalapeno peppers. Great on meat, great on sandwiches, wonderful with cream cheese. Blessings.\" This is accompanied by a low, consistent humming sound. >"

These are actually partly clear marbles and some half marbles. These are green. Then I have some little transparent light blue ones. The most important part is this part. This was a candle that I bought at a hardware store, and I peeled the wax off of it. The thing costs $12. It runs off of two C batteries. And when you turn it on, it kind of flickers, but the neat thing about it, it doesn't put off any heat. It's completely safe in a closed environment. What you want to do is you put your marbles, maybe in layers, whatever design you want to use, but when you get up to the candle, you want to put clear marbles around it.

And when you dig into that, the auto industry and agriculture have pretty much been sucking all the oxygen out of the trade deal room. But one sector also getting a shot in the arm, the drug makers. USMCA, this deal protects biologic drugs from generic competition for at least 10 years, compared to the current protection of eight years in Canada and just five years in Mexico. So, if you don't know what biologics are, they come from living organisms and they are given via injection. Some names you may have heard of, Enbrel, Humira, Rituxan, Keytruda. Let's bring in the man who's spent his entire life developing cutting-edge life-saving drug therapies.

You can read it online. What did I discover? That not all of the male-female disparity in tech may be the result of sexism. That at least some of it may be attributed to men and women having different goals for their careers and their lives. To cite just two examples, in the study Women, Careers, and Work-Life Preferences, published in the British Journal of Guidance and Counseling, the study's authors conclude that women, across populations, tend to look for more work-life balance while men tend to have a higher drive for status. And according to a study by Cal State Fullerton psychologist Richard Lippa, men, on average, tend to be more interested in things, while women tend to be more interested in people. These findings have been replicated many times. They've actually been cited by other researchers as a cause for the gender gap in tech. In other words, I didn't make this stuff up. In fact, after my document came under attack, evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller said that its empirical claims were scientifically accurate. But Google disagreed. Like, really disagreed. First, the company's newly appointed VP of Diversity, Integrity, and Governance, Danielle Brown, posted a memo that said my report advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent a memo to all employees saying that I crossed the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes. This was, he added, not okay. Then he fired me.\" A subtle whoosh sound is heard. The speaker continues, \"By that point, much to my shock, my document had gone viral. News outlets were branding it an anti-diversity manifesto.\" The sound of a page turning is heard. \"But if they had read what I wrote, they could see for themselves that it was pro-diversity. I had suggested multiple ways that we could get more women into tech without resorting to counterproductive discrimination. Ironic, isn't it? The company that hires some of the smartest people in the world couldn't handle a well-reasoned, scientific discussion. But my firing pales in comparison to the larger issue. Will Google force upon its users the same politically correct views that it forces upon its employees? The evidence is disturbing. Google already manipulates its products to fit a certain viewpoint. Just one example: YouTube, Google's video platform, restricts access to dozens of PragerU videos, along with videos made by other influential moderates and conservatives. Yes, Google is a business and can set its own policies. But for its billions of users, Google is their main gateway to information, the lens through which they view the world.\" The sound of car horns is heard. \"This makes Google, in some ways, more powerful than even the government. And that means Google has a special responsibility to, well, simply follow its own motto: Don't be evil. I'm James Damore for Prager University.\" The music then changes to a gentle, uplifting piano melody as he continues, \"Thank you for watching this video. To support PragerU and ensure millions of people watch this video and others like it, please consider making a tax-deductible donation.\" >",

To cite just two examples, in the study Women, Careers, and Work-Life Preferences, published in the British Journal of Guidance and Counseling, the study's authors conclude that women, across populations, tend to look for more work-life balance while men tend to have a higher drive for status. And according to a study by Cal State Fullerton psychologist Richard Lippa, men, on average, tend to be more interested in things, while women tend to be more interested in people. These findings have been replicated many times. They've actually been cited by other researchers as a cause for the gender gap in tech. In other words, I didn't make this stuff up. In fact, after my document came under attack, evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller said that its empirical claims were scientifically accurate. But Google disagreed. Like, really disagreed. First, the company's newly appointed VP of Diversity, Integrity, and Governance, Danielle Brown, posted a memo that said my report advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent a memo to all employees saying that I crossed the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes. This was, he added, not okay. Then he fired me.\" A subtle whoosh sound is heard. The speaker continues, \"By that point, much to my shock, my document had gone viral. News outlets were branding it an anti-diversity manifesto.\" The sound of a page turning is heard. \"But if they had read what I wrote, they could see for themselves that it was pro-diversity. I had suggested multiple ways that we could get more women into tech without resorting to counterproductive discrimination. Ironic, isn't it? The company that hires some of the smartest people in the world couldn't handle a well-reasoned, scientific discussion. But my firing pales in comparison to the larger issue. Will Google force upon its users the same politically correct views that it forces upon its employees? The evidence is disturbing. Google already manipulates its products to fit a certain viewpoint. Just one example: YouTube, Google's video platform, restricts access to dozens of PragerU videos, along with videos made by other influential moderates and conservatives. Yes, Google is a business and can set its own policies. But for its billions of users, Google is their main gateway to information, the lens through which they view the world.\" The sound of car horns is heard. \"This makes Google, in some ways, more powerful than even the government. And that means Google has a special responsibility to, well, simply follow its own motto: Don't be evil. I'm James Damore for Prager University.\" The music then changes to a gentle, uplifting piano melody as he continues, \"Thank you for watching this video. To support PragerU and ensure millions of people watch this video and others like it, please consider making a tax-deductible donation.\" >"

So, as we take a look out at this morning's sunrise, we had clouds coming on through. That'll be the story the next couple days. Started off in the 40s this morning, but we're going to be climbing to the 60s later. So yes, much of that snow and ice melting away. Now there's an atmospheric river, a relatively warm tropical storm over Northern California today. It's over Central California, kind of the Fresno area tomorrow, sagging down into our area on Wednesday. But as it comes on through, we have to battle our infamous rain shadow. You see a lot of evaporation here for the valley. And because this is a warm storm, it's a good soaking rain for the mountains but not a lot of snow. Here on the valley floor, we're talking about 69 today. That's a couple degrees above average, way higher than that 49 we had one day last week, which was the coldest high set for that date in record after winter weather had come barreling through. So we'll call it a 6% chance of rain here on the valley floor on Wednesday. Some computer models are saying a few hundredths of an inch, some are saying a tenth or two. Remember, this is a very wet storm, but can it overcome these relatively warm temperatures and the evaporation rate? That's the big question. As we head into Friday, we'll be dry that day with a little bit of cooler, fresher air coming onshore. And then we're right back up to those mid-60s this weekend with yet another chance of rain Saturday into Sunday.\" Papers rustle. A man then says, \"Alright, very good.
