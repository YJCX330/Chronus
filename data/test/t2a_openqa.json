There was that huge Yahoo hack of 500 million accounts, imagine that on a grander scale. Uh now, activists are very concerned about this. We have a quote from Fight for the Future campaign director Evan Greer, an internet uh privacy uh activism organization, who says that gutting these privacy rules won't just allow ISPs to spy on us and sell our personal information, it will also enable more unconstitutional mass government surveillance and fundamentally undermine our cybersecurity by making our sensitive personal information vulnerable to hackers, identity thieves, and foreign governments, which might sound like going too far.\""

The organization advised that the average person should consume 1 milliliter of water for every calorie consumed. This equates to 64 ounces a day on a 1900 calorie diet, which is close to the current USDA recommendation of 2,000 calories per day. A large review of water intake related studies found no scientific reports concluding this rule as good as law. The author of this review actually found several studies noting the potential dangers of following the 8x8 recommendation, including hyponatremia, a condition caused by drinking too much water, and leaving people feeling guilty if they weren't meeting that benchmark.\""

If you guys like our videos here on Most Amazing Top 10, hit the like button. Let's see if we can get it to 10,000 likes. We almost did it in the last video. We almost got featured on YouTube's homepage. So let's see if we can get us there. And I've actually traveled to Japan and many other awesome places around the world. If you guys want to see my Japan traveling vlogs, you guys can click right over here. Amazing experience. The food is amazing and the people are just so humble and nice. Alright, so we all know that every country has their own weird laws, and Japan is no exception. So let's take a look at the top 10 insane laws in Japan. Starting us off at number 10 with the dancing in nightclubs. Seems sort of ironic, doesn't it? But yes, dancing in certain nightclubs is illegal in Tokyo. The law has been around since 1948, and clubs that are less than 700 feet or don't have a dancing permit can actually face some pretty harsh fines for people dancing. And despite what you might think, clubs that don't actually meet the proper criteria actually enforce this dancing law and you can easily get kicked out for dancing. Obtaining a blowfish license comes in at number nine. You need to obtain a license or a certificate before being able to handle a blowfish. And it isn't an easy task. Chefs who have undergone at least two years of training at a pufferfish restaurant are entitled to take certification tests in order to be able to cook it. They must pass extremely difficult practical and written exams. The emperor is also banned from eating it, just in case he gets a poisonous bite. Being fat comes onto this list at number eight. Japan's pretty rude. Since 2008, it is illegal to be fat in Japan under the Metabo Law. The maximum waistline is 33.5 inches for men over the age of 40 and 35.4 inches for women. But instead of jail time, these people who exceed the limit will be given a strict diet and they must adhere to it for several months. This Metabo Law aims to save the country money by preventing illnesses rather than spending money to treat them. And now at number seven is brewing your own alcohol. Home brewing anything over 1% is illegal in Japan and the penalties involve up to five years in prison and or a $5,000 in fines. I don't see the point of buying all of this expensive brewing equipment if you can't even make anything over 1%. I'm sure that there's a lot of people brewing their own wine and beer at home that is most likely over the 1% limit, but they are keeping it, you know, on the down low. It is forbidden to damage or throw money away, and this comes into number six. Why are people throwing money away? Why does this have to be a law? If you are caught doing this, you could be fi-\""

In fact, Mentel, a well-known market research firm, has discovered that there's been a 5% reduction in reduced sodium claims from 2010 to 2011. The fact is, salt enhances flavor, and when consumers see a reduced sodium claim on a food package, they automatically assume that that food probably lacks flavor. Several years ago, High Quality Organics developed an all-purpose no salt blend, and our aim was simple. We wanted to help food companies reduce sodium without losing flavor. Our all-purpose no salt blend is a beautiful combination of herbs with a slightly spicy finish. It's great for vegetable dishes or really any dish. Because our all-purpose no salt blend has been so popular, we've developed several others. Our no salt barbecue blend, perfect for a rub on a dark meat or your favorite chicken. It has a great balance of salt and sweet and it has a hint of onion and garlic. And for all you garlic lovers out there, we have a no salt garlic blend. It's a wonderful blend of citrus herbs and garlic and it's great for chicken, vegetables, or fish dishes. Now, if you're not crazy about garlic, but you love seafood, our no salt seafood blend might be the one for you. It has a wonderful combination of citrus and herbs and it's great for any fish. And for those of you who like a little kick to your dish, we have our no salt spicy blend. It marries wonderfully with soups, stews, or slow cooker meals.\" Throughout the speech, the sound of a small glass jar being placed on a hard surface is heard several times."

Personally, I prefer the fine line detail in this matter. It makes it easier to follow with the scroll saw blade. The drilling the holes anywhere in the waste area is acceptable. Honestly, it does not matter where you would drill a hole because it's all waste anyway, but personally, I like to go towards the corner areas, the sharp corners such as here. This is where I already drilled a hole and I would make my first cut going this way and working around. It'd be just as effective going putting the starter hole here and working this way or starter hole here and working this way, just working your way toward a sharp corner. Sometimes you will not have any sharp corners on your patterns such as if this was your main part of your pattern all the way around.\" He then continues speaking as the sound of drawing on paper is heard, \"Well, I'll I'll draw it on since this is waste. If your pattern was something like this, your waste area. Depending on how you're going to display your project when finished, if this is going to be a wall hanging, I would put the starter hole down here at the bottom, then start cutting going this direction. The reason for that is, if your project is on the wall, it's easier to to deceive the eye if there's a slight burr starting to stop your blade from cutting. You'll get more experience on how to remove the burr as you get more experience with the scroll saw. Going this way and if this was the rounded area on bottom, follow these if all these areas right here were curved such as this, I would put my starter hole down here on the bottom. Same reason. It's easier to to deceive the eye. But like I said, put your starter hole closest to a sharp point. It could be right here towards this tail, could be right here in this corner, it could be in this corner. It could this isn't really a sharp point. But hopefully you understand what I'm trying to say about making your first cut towards a sharp corner. It doesn't matter if it's if it's an inside corner or an outside corner, it makes no difference. Just your first cut towards the corner.\" This is all accompanied by synthesized background music."

Then you would go down here and you would pick up, you'd pick up the stitch that you drop and then you would start loading the bars back up by pulling them over and off each bar at a time. The bad thing when this ends up happening is that then your stitches look a little stretched out. So sometimes they look off. So if you just be cautious to make sure that you don't connect them, this is a really easy way to make a tube without using double-pointed needles. Now this ended up being closed at the bottom because I just cast it on straight and knitted. But you could what you could do is you would cast on double the amount you were making and then you would do the whole thing where you pick up one on one needle, one on the other and you just keep doing that and then you would end up making the round. So I hope this was helpful. If you have any questions, please comment below and there'll be new videos soon.\""

I remember like doing even just like competitive matches or clan matches on Call of Duty 4 or like Modern Warfare 2 or something like that. And like it's a whole new game. Instead of just running in, like getting a death and then running back in, you've got to run in, and if you die, you've basically screwed up your team for dying and like there's consequences. So much pressure. So like these guys, if one of these splits up, especially with a million dollars on the line, imagine being the one guy who messes up here.

But yeah, like, the thing is like places like this you see some of the best players make mistakes. So like some of the, like, you know, the underdogs make the best moves. So it's anyone's game. Call of Duty is like all about how you're playing that day, how focused you are, not making mistakes. Like if you're going to win this, and I'll take this from OpTic Nadeshot, the winner of this is going to be the person who makes the least mistakes.\" The woman says, \"Thank you so much, Tom, for chatting to us. Yeah. Don't forget to log on to twitch.tv and check out the Call of Duty live stream from there. You can see all the best players.

When a something heavy has been put on top of the carpeting for an extended amount of time, what will happen is these fiber bundles will actually lay down, and they won't easily pop back up because they've been reset. That resiliency's been reset to a different position. So what we need to do is trick it back into being resilient. The fiber twist is still there. The twist that all these filaments are twisted into is still there. But now it's laying sideways. So how do we coax this back up?

If you don't have the update, go to the software update section and look for it there or it will update automatically overnight. So, that's the new TVOS 9.2 update for the 4th generation Apple TV.

And I just love the quality of her pieces. Like they, you know, tend to be in the like $40 to $80 range, but I find that they don't tarnish, they don't turn at all and the quality is really amazing and it's so my style. So, love this ring. And then secondly, I got these really cute earrings from Revolve by Vanessa Mooney and they're just like this like kind of they pull through and they kind of hang, but it's a little cross with a ruby that dangles down and you could like wrap it if you have multiple um holes or you can just leave it through the front one like I've done.

I have got shapewear before where I literally can't wait to get it off. I've gone on a night out with friends and been like, oh my goodness, I feel sick. So definitely don't make that mistake. Make sure you get your shapewear right. With High Studios, it's shapewear you don't want to rip off. I've still got the new tights on and they are so comfortable. They do a few different types of shapewear. So they've just launched these. They also do a body which looks perfect and it's something I'm definitely going to invest in post-birth. Not because I'm not going to be happy with my body post-birth, just because it makes me feel more comfortable in clothes. Just because it adds a silhouette to all of my lumps and bumps. If you get your underwear wrong, such as if I had underwear on which dug in to me here, you'd be able to see it in outfits like this and it really isn't the most flattering look. So getting your underwear and your shapewear right is the key to looking good on the outside and feeling good, of course, as well. So the next outfit I have to show you is again from Topshop. It is this jumper dress. So it's a brown color which is a big color for this season. All of the kind of nudes and the browns are back for autumn winter. It's amazing quality. So really, really thick, really lovely quality. It's non-maternity. None of the items I'm going to show you are maternity, but I just always size up.\""

And uh so that makes the character be completely different or unexpected for me anyways, you know, the character that I that I that I knew, that I got to understand in Sicario, this character now had different levels of uh humanity to him that I didn't see in the character in the previous film in the first in the first film. So, that that was exciting. You know, this uh the character that Josh Brolin plays and uh hires me to be part of another covert operation and that and um basically just when everything starts to everything starts to fall uh fall fall apart in the plan, um Josh's character, Matt, basically ask Alejandro to do something and Alejandro feels that that's not the right thing to do. And this puts the two of them, you know, to go head-to-head. And, you know, I got a chance to play with my my buddy, Josh Brolin, is always great. And uh and it's, you know, it really works on film.

Uh no, but uh but yeah, he he's uh he's he's huge for this piece. And um when I finished shooting uh Sicario, I never thought that I would do a um a sequel to this. And then when I was called by the producers to and my manager and agent, hey, we got a script of Solda Soldado for for a sequel. I was uh, well, let's see. And you know, right from the top, from the first pages, it was like, this is great. You know, it was it was Taylor all over it. And so, we do as actors and a director and everyone involved in this film, you know, we just try to, you know, um bring that Taylor script to life and uh for the most part is like it does the other way, you know, we we're brought alive because of his work, because of Taylor's work.

The IMF is now expecting 2018 average inflation to clock in at 4.7%, slightly above its previous forecast of 4.2%. The figure exceeds the 2% to 4% target set by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas or BSP. Inflation jumped to 5.2% in June, bringing the average to 4.3% in the first half of the year. Brewer attributes the spike to higher global oil prices, the weakness of the peso, and the excise taxes under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion or TRAIN Law.\" Following a percussive sound effect, she continues, \"Facebook shares plunged as much as 22% Wednesday after it reported weaker than expected user growth.

Now that will actually wipe everything off your phone. You'll have a fresh restored phone, but again, like I said before, you're going to back up all this stuff before you do this so you can just sync it all back and you'll be good to go. Here's a few little tips to help you out if you do end up running into problems or something like that where your device gets like locked up. All you can do is hold the home and the power button in until it reboots and that may fix it right there. And if rebooting doesn't work, another thing you can try is putting your device into DFU or recovery mode. I'm not going to explain how to do those in this video, but if you want to you can just Google it. I've got guides on it too. You pretty much do the same thing with holding the home and power buttons in, it's just like a different process of doing it and then you can restore your device in iTunes. That's just if you have issues, any problems, which most of you guys probably won't. Alright, so there you go. Hopefully you guys enjoyed this. If you went through the process and everything went okay, you should have iOS 8 on your device, go ahead and enjoy it. If you want to, I'll put a link down below to my video I did on iOS 8 to like show you all the new features in it or if you're considering whether you should upgrade to this yet, you can go check that out to give you an idea. If you guys haven't done so, make sure you go ahead and subscribe to my YouTube channel right there so you don't miss any of my future videos. Once the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus comes out, I'm be getting both of those, doing tons of videos on it for you guys, plus probably some videos on iOS 8, who knows. Tons of videos coming, make sure you subscribe so you don't miss any of them and I will see you guys in the next one. Peace."

For this video, we've gone with all Samsung products, so your results may vary slightly, but remember, if you purchased your soundbar from Apt, you get lifetime technical support, so feel free to call into our service department and they can help walk you through the whole process as well.

So we first include uh one shield library, and we declare the fan to be on pin number 11, that's where the pin is connected to the relay.

While these are still really hot, these are just out of the oven, I'm just pushing the base of that cup into the little circle shape that we made. This is actually going to provide the really nice indent of your saucer. It's going to hold your Oreo shot in place, and it's going to make your saucers look more authentic. Once you've allowed those saucers to completely dry, you want to take that melted dark chocolate, and I'm just spooning it on and spreading it out so that it goes to all of the edges of my little saucer. And then you'll see I've got kind of like a little chocolate drip tray here. So you want to give it a couple of really hefty shakes,\" followed by a shaking sound. The woman continues, \"which is going to smooth the chocolate out. It's going to drain off any excess, and it's going to force it down into that little center mold. Use your finger just to rim around the edges to make it really, really nice and neat. And it kind of makes your saucers shiny and clean like actual crockery. Once your cookie shots have completed baking, let them sit in their tray for 5 minutes before trying to pull them out. So these are still quite warm, but letting them sit just allows them to sweat a little bit and makes them easier to remove. You can see I'm just gently placing my thumb in and I'm just pulling them out. They are sliding out really, really easily. With everything out now and cooled, I'm going to quickly show you how to make those spoons. So a spoon mold is not something that everyone is going to have, but it is a fairly commonly available chocolate mold. I'm just drizzling in some of that melted white chocolate, being careful not to get too much of it up around the outside edges of the mold. And then we're going to make sure that we give it a couple of really, really good taps on the bench,\" followed by a tapping sound. She continues, \"and that's just going to force that chocolate right down into all the grooves of the spoons. Pop those off into the fridge, let them set, and your white chocolate spoons are done. Now it's important here that you line your cookie shots, or else that milk is going to soak into the cookie and it's all going to seep out onto the bench and make a huge mess. So two teaspoons of white chocolate straight into the bottom of that cookie shot, and then you just want to turn it. You want that white chocolate to completely coat the inside, and I also made sure that mine came all the way up over the outer lip of my cookie shot glass. Make sure that you're shaking out as much of the excess as you can, while still being sure that the entire inside is covered. If you happen to see any cookie poking through that white chocolate, cover it up with a tiny little bit more white chocolate, because that's where your cookie shot's going to leak. While that white chocolate's still fresh and wet, just flatten down your Oreo crumbs in that bowl and just dip the very, very top of your cookie shot in, so you get all of those beautiful Oreo crumbs kind of around the rim and around the edge. Make sure you repeat this process with all of your Oreo cookie shots, and I cannot stress enough how important it is to make sure that that inside is completely coated so that they are watertight. When your spoons come out of the fridge all nice and set, it's as simple as popping them out. Look how cute they are. If you just run your fingers down the side of them, you'll just be able to knock off any little excess or messy ridges on your spoons. Pop those off onto your little cookie saucers. To fill your Oreo shots, it is as simple as taking a little bit of milk. You can also make an Oreo milkshake here. And I'm going to finish mine off like I said with a little bit of canned whipped cream. I did a bit of a test on our Oreo cookie shots to see how long they would remain watertight for. This display one that I've got in the corner of the screen has been like that for about 4 hours. So I am happy that they are completely watertight and they're not going to leak. A little bit of that whipped cream on top, a sprinkling of crushed Oreos to decorate. There you've got a fully edible saucer, a delicious white chocolate spoon, and a stunningly decadent Oreo cookie shot. I hope you guys have loved this idea. I hope you've loved my take on this new sweet trend phenomenon. If you love it, make sure you share it so others can enjoy it as well. And as always, thanks very much for tuning in to My Cupcake Addiction.\" Light, upbeat music plays."

I have recipes for red salsa which I'll put in which is in my book. And I'll put the link to my book right here where my hand is and it'll also be down at the bottom in the link. Anyways, for green salsa you will need several ingredients. You'll need for a medium spiciness salsa you want about four of these Serrano peppers, half an onion, a handful of cilantro, and about four tomatillos. Tomatillos will come in kind of a little wrapper like this. You will remove that and throw it away and then rinse this off. They are will be sticky. Then about two to three cloves of garlic. You will place all these ingredients inside a blender or I in my case I'm using this is a Bella kitchen blender. It's like a kind of one of those rocket blender things and blend those up. You want to salt it to taste. Usually about two or three pinches and that'll give you a good tasting salt green salsa. Anyways just prepare that. Some people like to prepare that first. They think that the longer it's blended the the better the taste, but in my experience it doesn't really make much of a difference. So, let's get on to making the tacos. I'm gonna blend this up real fast and then I'll get on to the taco.\" Throughout the speech, there are several thuds of objects being placed on a surface, along with rustling and crinkling sounds.

But things began to heat up with 42's very solid ticket sales, and The Great Gatsby made headlines just two weeks ago as it surged past expectations. And now with Man of Steel, Pacific Rim, and The Conjuring on the horizon, the studio is hoping to keep the momentum going with one of its most reliable franchises, The Hangover. 2009's sleeper hit and its sequel have become the top-grossing R-rated comedies of all time, a success which has enabled its three stars to demand 15 million each for this third and supposedly final film. That's three times what they each got for the sequel, and once again they'll also be getting a piece of the film's box office haul as well. But such sky-high salaries are not only indicative of The Hangover's success, but of how the current free-agent culture of Hollywood allows talent agencies to bundle talent, in this case CAA, and hold said franchise hostage until the studio caves to their demands. In the old days, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis would all be under contract, or if they had different agents, perhaps one could be persuaded to cave. One has to wonder, though, what Ken Jeong is getting paid, as he's arguably The Hangover's secret weapon. Not a secret to producers, though, as his role has been expanded for this third outing. Justin Bartha, Mike Epps, and Heather Graham also return, as well as the baby from the first flick, all growns up. Meanwhile, John Goodman and Melissa McCarthy are joining the party. But while Warner Brothers has confidence in this franchise, Universal isn't scared. They're releasing the latest entry of their own franchise juggernaut, Fast & Furious, opposite The Hangover Part III, whereas in the past, The Hangover only had to contend with Land of the Lost and then Kung Fu Panda 2. As a result, Hollywood is expecting a slightly lower opening for The Hangover Part III than the Wolfpack's last trip to the box office. Indeed, Bradley Cooper already seems to be moving on to the next stage of his career, serious actor, while Ed Helms is set to take over for Chevy Chase in the rebooted Vacation franchise. Only Galifianakis seems to be hanging around, much like Alan. Are audiences also keen to stick around or move on as well? Let's go find out.\" This is followed by electronic music tones."

With the side that is to be the spine of the blade against the anvil, a few careful hammer strokes will flatten out any bumps and really make the steel start to look knifelike. The hot steel behaves a lot like clay under the hammer blows, making it quite easy to sculpt into simple shapes. Harder hammer strokes are focused on the edge of the blade so that it narrows where it will be sharpened and widens at the spine for strength. Once the blade is the approximate shape that is desired, the unshaped end of the rod is cut down to the length of a suitable handle and pounded until it reaches the thickness of the blade's spine.

Without proper supervision, puppies can quickly become seriously injured and may even die. Unsupervised puppies can destroy your belongings costing you a small fortune to repair or replace. Another disadvantage of leaving your puppy unsupervised is that they can also develop long-term behavioral issues that are difficult to address once they're established such as excessive barking, adult house soiling problems and many others. When you're unable to supervise your puppy because you're physically or mentally absent, it's best to confine them somewhere safe where no harm can come to them or to your belongings. This sets your puppy up for success, since unsupervised access to any part of your home, indoors or outdoors, provides too many opportunities for your puppy to make bad choices. A long-term confinement area has many advantages for you and your puppy. The most important of which is that your puppy learns to self-settle and rest calmly and quietly. This is something that does not occur naturally and must be taught. In order to develop properly physically, a puppy needs to sleep for up to 18 hours a day. When done properly, a long-term confinement area teaches your puppy to deal with being separated from you and to even enjoy spending time alone. This will assist in preventing separation anxiety.\""

Some of these are fun ways to declutter, kind of like games, and some of these are more like an overhaul your life declutter approach. So one way to approach it is to use the minimalism game. So this was actually originated from the minimalist, which I will link in the description below. So find a friend who wants to simplify their life alongside you and recruit them for a period of 30 days. So on the first day you get rid of one item. It could be something as small as like a toothbrush that you should have thrown out a long time ago. That's a bit gross. On the second day it's two items, so two product manuals that you haven't referred to in five years, and so on and so forth. No matter what, these items need to be out of your home by midnight. So if you're someone who thrives on accountability and maybe you're kind of competitive, this is an awesome way to start decluttering your life. The second way that you can approach it is the five item rule. So as you're cleaning out your bathroom cupboards, get rid of five moisturizers and scrubs that you haven't touched. As you are cleaning your kitchen, get rid of the five takeaway containers that you don't use.\""

Uh, there also is a texture on the back which helps for grippability. It feels more comfortable than the smoother plastic on the old one. I can also see that we have these new joysticks which now have a concaved design as opposed to the convex design here. Uh, we also have a new D-pad with these larger controls and some say that these controls are a little more organic feeling than they were before. Uh, we also have these new buttons up here for share and option. We also have a built-in speaker. Uh, so this can play back audio from the game right on your controller. Alternatively, you can also connect a headset right here. So the headset also supports the microphone. So for example, if you have your Apple AirPods, you could listen to your game as well as use the microphone input uh through that single headset. You also have the auxiliary uh port here uh which is available for future expansion. Now, we also have our standard uh Sony controls here and if you look here, pretty much the same. It doesn't look like there's a big change here. Same size. We also have our shoulder buttons and trigger buttons, which have also been redesigned. Again, if you look at that. You can see they're a little bit longer now this time. And they're also curved a bit. So it adds a little more uh more or better ergonomics to it.

The big point here is that you're doing a variety of things keeping your pet's immune system healthy. It means feeding your pet well, using some type of natural holistic diet, looking at avoiding as many insecticides, herbicides, the toxins as possible, that your pet gets regular exercise, that you're minimizing the number of serious things that can compromise your pet's immune system such as vaccines. And then secondly, you consider adding some type of supplement, helping boost your pet's immune system. I I suggest a natural health supplement. I have one, called the dog supplement or the cat supplement and here they are here. It doesn't need to be them but something like them as well. Consider bathing but using one of the natural flea shampoos. Bathing is effective at soothing irritated skin and eliminating some of the adult fleas. Use cool water and leave the shampoo on for 10 minutes. Your pet can be safely shampooed twice a week. There are a number of of effective holistic flea shampoos that do work well. Some of the ingredients that work for dogs and cats include neem oil, eucalyptus oil, and cedarwood oil. A big point I want to also make is avoiding tea tree oil. It's very toxic to cats and small dogs, although it is found in some of the natural flea control products.\""

But we just want to show you this is the post-drying. This rug was cleaned with detergents made for this fiber, rinsed completely off, and laid flat on this floor, which you can see it's plywood floor here. And because it's a Chinese needlepoint rug, this rug to maintain its shape had to be tacked out. Well that's what that means is along the whole perimeter, the left, right, front, and bottom sides, all had to be tacked out on this plywood to maintain maintain its shape while it dries. You can see in the far left corner and the far right corner, machines that are made to dry it and here in the front you can see some commercial drying machines to rapidly dry this rug to make sure there is no loss of integrity in the coloring, especially those deep rich reds that you can see on the rug, those floral designs, and also to help it maintain its shape. So if you have a rug like this, feel free to give us a call again here in the Boston area, 781-995-0683.

He uh disgraced Asano's honor and uh enough was enough. Asano snapped, drew his sword, and cut Kira. Cut him but didn't kill him. This was a huge no-no in the Edo Castle. So, Asano was forced to perform seppuku or ritual suicide. While Kira got away scot-free. He must have had good connections. The Ako clan heard about this and they did not like it. They said, 'What, bruh?' They avenge Asano's death by killing Kira over a year later, decapitating him, bringing his head back to Sengakuji Temple and washing it in this well.

Dogs learn best after exercise. Particularly if you have a high energy dog, understand that they need to get rid of that energy before it's realistic to expect them to absorb new concepts.\" A dog barks. \"There's nothing wrong with your dog if they're energetic. That's how we made them to be good workers and have the energy to last all day. So we have to counter that in our more laid-back culture today by exercising them so that they can more easily comprehend new things. Tip five. Be flexible. Things will rarely go exactly as you plan. For example, maybe you and your friends are planning a camping trip and you're excited to hang around the campfire with your friends and your dog. But in reality, when your dog sees the campsite, they get totally freaked out by that campfire and they want nothing to do with it. You may need to adjust your expectations for this particular teaching moment and perhaps create distance between your dog and the campfire. Maybe work on something simpler for now. Doing this can really help to build your dog's confidence over time. Always be flexible and be prepared to change your game plan when necessary. And if you're serious about making a change in the way people teach their dogs, start by buying your dog food from a company that promotes positive training like PetFlow. See, it's what PetFlow doesn't sell that makes them worth being the place to get your dog food from. Support companies that don't sell choke, prong, or electric collars. Get your dog's food automatically...\""

It's sort of the lazy man's risotto, which is sort of a contradiction in terms because for the most part, risotto you have to pay constant attention to, but it's really really easy. So don't get scared by that. We're chopping up an onion here. No big deal. Little pieces because it's going to be in there with the rice. So you don't want to chomp into a big piece of onion. Just sort of hide it in there. So small onion. A little technique here, which is very easy, which you can take a look at, James. You want to come up?\" The second speaker says, \"Sure.\" The first speaker says, \"But slice along the sides, I'm sorry, not on the side, straight down with the onion in pieces like this. You can see I don't have great knife work myself. It's not like a cooking show or anything like that. But you get all the way down in there after you've cut the onion in half. And then you just come on the side carefully, chopping in the side here. So you've not gone all the way through to the edge and you're basically keeping the onion together, but it's sort of diced. And then all you have to do is cut right down and it's already in these wonderful little pieces. And when you get to the end there, you kind of flip it over and you can go this way and uh it's sort of just that simple. So, now again, with risotto, you do have to pay constant attention to it. But it's really really easy. All you have to do is stir. That might be too much onion anyway. So what we're going to do, put some extra virgin olive oil in the pan here. Again, there's no science to this, which is why it's so easy, which is why I do this instead of baking. Because you just sort of eyeball it. We're going to make a whole bunch of rice.\" The second speaker asks, \"What do you have cooking on over there?\" The first speaker replies, \"Oh, actually, this is a good question, James. This is chicken stock. Low sodium chicken stock. We're going to make it warm. It's part of cooking risotto. Start with warm stock, from a box. Low sodium because we want to control how much salt we put this in ourselves rather than being subject to...\""

But you don't want it to get too close to the roots, so you're just going to avoid the roots and just put this blood and bone in these channels you make.

You can see the difference here if I set them up there. This one's got a much bigger magnet and on the back, it's uh pretty much it says it's a high performance speaker. Oh, you know what? This is uh okay, well. I'm a little confused here. This is the speaker that I took off on the other side that was bad.\" This is followed by a clattering sound. He continues, \"Of course, this is the speaker I just now took off which is good. Now, the high performance speaker that I'm putting on, here we go, it's Monday, is right here. Now you can see the difference. That magnet is a lot thicker than this one, which is the original speaker. And on the back it says premium. That's what I stuck on the opposite side. So, really, all I have to do now at this point, I'm going to change these little connectors right here and they're very easy to do. Here's the old speaker that was not working. You see I took it off and I put it on the other speaker that I just stuck in, the high performance speaker. I am going to do the same with this one here. I'm going to take this connector off on the one I just took off the uh back of the caravan, the speaker, and I'm going to put this connector on the high performance one. So, all you need is a soldering gun, a little bit of solder, and you can do this. And it also helps to have a little pair of needle-nose pliers. Makes it a lot easier. So let me go ahead and switch this around and we'll look at it.\" A metallic clattering sound is heard. The man then says, \"All right, now I got my connectors pretty much soldered. Here's the speaker I'm going to be using, there's the old connector. I uh unsoldered it. And here's the one I need to use. I'm going to simply just kind of stick this back on here like this, push it on there. It's on. Now all I got to do is solder those little wires back on each side of that speaker, and this speaker is ready to go in. Now, um if you do just have to uh change speakers and you get an identical speaker, the connectors are the same. You don't, you don't, you don't have to go through this process. I'm just doing it because I don't want to have to spend $40 on the same identical speakers with the same connectors. So, uh you might want to research this, this might work for you. If you have to do this or if you want to use high performance speakers and if you have the connector, uh the support bracket.\""

You see darlings, Stir-up Sunday is a special time when family gather together and take it in turns to stir the pudding mixture whilst making a wish for the year ahead. Traditionally, charms are added such as silver coins that represent wealth. In fact, as a child, grandmother Josie once found a threepenny bit inside of her Christmas pudding. So in memory of my grandmother, I'm going to make a wish for the year ahead using this threepence coin, which is a threepenny bit, which I found inside of her house after she sadly passed away. So darlings, this definitely is an extra special Christmas pudding. Okay darlings, I'm going to show you how to steam your homemade Christmas pudding. Be warned though, you need to set aside three to four hours for this. First off, prepare your equipage. Well, grease your pudding basin like so. Then three-quarters fill with the mixture. Then prepare your pudding basin for steaming, it should look something like this. More details on the website. Righty-ho darlings, now grab a large saucepan. Put a saucer in the bottom to stop.\""

You know, so we've had a lot of storms, power has gone out sometimes, and there are things that even if you are like me and have a generator that might kick on, you know, in 10, 15, 20 seconds later after a power outage, there are some things that just don't handle power outages well, any type of outage.\" A thud sound is heard. \"And one is my desktop computer. You know, you don't want to really just unplug that from the wall because they will go off and it's just not good for them. There are things like maybe your TV, you know, anything with a cooling fan that maybe will run for a while even when it's powered down. You know, it's just not good, like projector and things like that. So, you may have a lot of things. This will keep them running when you have a power outage. Now it won't keep them running indefinitely. This one is the 550. There's actually a new version, the 600, but 550 volts, I believe, and so the new one will go up to 600 volts. And I just want to give you a quick tour of it. So if you have power interruptions and things that you can't have interrupted, I think this is a good way to do it. As you can see here, we have eight normal outlets, grounded outlets on the top here, and it's a big plastic housing. It's pretty heavy because you can replace the battery. There's on the front here, there are a couple little LEDs, power on and replace battery, or there's a couple colored LEDs in there and so this will usually just be green or green flashing. I'll kind of show that to you. But when it gets red, you want to replace the battery. There's also a power button right there. And replacing the battery, although I've never done it, so you know, keep in mind that I don't think you have to do it that often, is just as simple as taking this off and then replacing this battery here. And looks like, I don't even know how you do it, but you can see how big the, you know, you can see how big this battery is. You know, it's probably...\" A click is heard, followed by a thud. \"...it just kind of drops out like this. And here it is. There's the battery. And it's just a couple connectors on the top.\" A thud sound is heard. \"Just take those out and put them back in.\" Another thud sound occurs. \"Now I've seen this battery available at least on Amazon for like 20 bucks, 17 bucks, something like that. So replacing the battery, even if you get the housing, you know, if you can get a good deal on the housing, you can buy the battery and you may want to buy a new battery because that's probably the thing that's most important. So you can see here...\" A click sounds, followed by electronic beeping. \"Ah, I just hit the power button. And you can hear it now because now it's saying no power. And so it's on battery power.\" Another click sounds. \"So let me hit that, just turned it off here again. So pretty heavy, this is probably going to want to be on the floor. Obviously, you're going to kind of want it to hide it away in most cases. For me, it's just on the floor by my desk where I've got my, you know, computer plugged in. There's a 5-foot power cable. I'll show you that here. There's a circuit breaker button. So let's, let me see if I can show you here.\""

A red dot, orange dot, purple dot, and kind of a teal dot. And then a nice simple red print. That's really nice. It's a, you know, it's a, it's a big enough shape but it's very simplistic. I really like that. We've got that in purple and in blue. And then here's another small print. It's got these little, um, they're almost like pointy flowers. I like that. And we've got that in blue and yellow. And then this is almost reminds me of an argyle, you know, the overlapping crisscrossing shapes. So we've got two of those.

So I'm going to kind of keep that in mind as I'm putting this pattern together, kind of plan something out that's going to use these prints in a really cheerful way and keep them in big shapes.

Next, you need to choose four chords from a minor key. The original song is in E minor, so we'll just stick with that.

And the first beat will be used to ground into the root note, and the second beat will be used to fly away, but more on that in step two.\" The woman instructs, \"Next, delete the second quarter note beat of each chord.\" The man says, \"Like that,\" and there are sounds of a computer keyboard clicking. He continues, \"And then over that first coordinate beat of each chord, play the root note a couple times with a rest in between,\" accompanied by more keyboard clicks. The woman says, \"And this is what you'll end up with.\" The man explains, \"And be sure to play one root note of each chord on an offbeat 16th note, like this one here.

A swooshing sound is heard as the woman says, \"Step two, air.\" The man explains, \"Right, now that you've grounded your baseline, it's time to launch it into the melodic air. So, over the second quarter note beat of each chord, you could allow your baseline to break free of its low notes only restriction and elevate its range and melodic interest with some high notes.\" The woman instructs, \"So, choose three ascending or descending notes from your scale and play them in a higher octave over your first chord.\" The man says, \"Like this,\" followed by keyboard clicks. \"And then do something similar over your third chord, like this,\" again with clicks. \"And all of these are 16th notes, and also be sure to start on the offbeat 16th note for even more syncopation.\" The woman adds, \"Then over your second chord, you're actually not going to go higher because that'll be too much of a good thing.\" The man says, \"Exactly. So just add in a couple of low notes there, like this,\" followed by keyboard clicks. \"And then finally, over your last chord, you're actually going to use the same three notes that you used over your third chord, but reverse their order, like this. Magic,\" accompanied by more clicks. The woman announces, \"And now, it's time to have a listen to what we've made.\" The man concludes, \"And if you want to keep learning how to make great music so you can get discovered, then we've got a video lined up on how to write better rhythms. So click that when it pops up in a few seconds, and we'll meet you there.\" An electronic music track with a prominent bassline and melody is played."

And it's a liability, as we've talked about throughout the week, it is a legal liability to be Trump's right hand man because he's looking for someone who will protect him legally and politically. And it appears that Mick Mulvaney is stupid enough to take that job. And so, although today is a sad day for us, knowing that he'll be serving as chief of staff, I do know that there's the huge silver lining of Mick Mulvaney getting into all sorts of trouble and also being humiliated by Trump in the future.\""

Well, of course, back in our day, you scraped that mold off and you kept on eating. Never got sick. So I have one jar here that didn't get water bath canned. So what I did was I turned it upside down. What that will do is that will heat the ring long enough to seal the jar. Now, if you can look real closely, you can already tell that this is gonna thicken up nicely. Do you see the bubbles? Those are bubbles that came up from the bottom. And look at the top. You can see the bubble. That bad boy is gelling already and it is steaming hot. So, if you don't water bath, you're not gonna have me telling you that you're gonna get sick on jellies. Did it for many, many years. I prefer to water bath can them because they stay fresher longer on your shelf. You don't have to worry about the wax melting, you don't have to worry about the lid popping, but we'll just open that jar first. If I get gutsy enough to try it. My hands are burning so bad, I'm afraid what it's gonna do to my stomach. You know, I even tried sticking my hands in a bowl of milk. Nah, doesn't work. So please protect your hands when you do this through the entire process until you get them in jars, keep those hands protected. Well, I hope you enjoy and I hope you learn something and I hope you give this a shot. Because it really is very good jelly. It does not taste like jalapeno peppers. Great on meat, great on sandwiches, wonderful with cream cheese. Blessings.\" This is accompanied by a low, consistent humming sound."

Now, this isn't a natural ear. I hasten to add, this is an artificial ear right on his forearm. Crazy. Australian performance artist Stelarc had an extra ear grown on his forearm. Unable to find surgeons willing to create the arm ear, he had to wait over 10 years from when he first had the idea to having the procedure in 2007. He is now even pursuing surgery to have Wi-Fi installed in his arm ear so that the world can listen to what his arm ear is hearing. Can I say arm ear anymore? This is creepy. In regards to his third ear, Stelarc said, 'It's when art is surprising that it becomes interesting.' He wants the world to re-examine the body. Getting horny, but not in a good way here at number... we have Zhang Ruifang, aka the woman who grew a horn. Would we call a horn a body part? I guess if the person was a goat, then absolutely. But a Chinese woman has grown a horn. Wow. 104-year-old Zhang first started growing one horn at one side of her forehead at age 100. Now, the horn is officially known as a cutaneous horn, and it is made out of keratin, which is the same kind of protein we have in our nails. As one horn reached almost 3 inches, another started to grow on the opposite side of her face. So like, Zhang is pretty old and this happened when she was 100. Maybe this is just what happens at the next stage of human life. Like, you know, I guess back in the day when people started living to 30, some people were like, 'Whoa, gray hairs.' Maybe the next stage for humans is horns. Let me know what you think in the comments below. Here we are at number six, meet Bill Durks, the guy with two faces, two noses, and three eyes.\""

Yeah.\" \"Yeah, that'd be something good.\" \"The the kid catches it before Miyagi ever can and he's been trying for years. And then he gets all upset about it.\" \"Yeah. That would be pretty impressive.\" \"The second one starts with him sitting there trying to catch it and he finally catches it. Then he lets it go.\" \"Who? Miyagi or the little guy?\" \"Yeah, Miyagi does. He finally catches it at the beginning of the second one.\" \"I think if you go through all the effort of catching it with your chopsticks, you should at least eat it. You know?\" \"He let it go. Now, I want to know, how does he get that fly trained to just fly over that table that he that he's kneeling at to try to catch it?\" \"Yes. They have people in Hollywood that like work exclusively with fly trainers, I'm sure. Right? Here comes the fly trainer. He's got a little chair and a whip.\" \"Yes.\" \"Exactly.\" \"So, this is a great drink. Um, probably originated in New Orleans.\" \"Yes.\" \"Tujague's Bar.\" \"Yeah, you're right. And, uh, you know, it became popular right around the 1960s, just like when other ice cream drinks have.\" \"Yeah, it was like all over in the sixties. And then and sort of died off until right now, we're resurrecting it.\" \"Exactly. Yeah. It's a great drink. It's a great after, uh, after-dinner drink, uh, on its own like a dessert.\" \"Yeah, it's like Andes Candies. We used to go to this restaurant as a kid, and as you'd leave, you know when they bring your check, they would have Andes Candies on there. And I was like, oh my gosh. We were always fighting for those. This is like Andes Candies. In a glass.\" \"Yeah, exactly.\" \"And this is our blended version, right?\" \"Mhm. We do have a shaken version, so you can watch a video on that.\" \"Yeah. Traditionally, I think it was made shaken.\" \"Yep.\" \"But nothing beats a good ice cream drink.\" \"Exactly.\" \"Except maybe catching a fly with your chopsticks.\" Laughter follows. \"Right?\" \"All right, let's begin.\" \"Let's make it.\" \"We need one and a half ounces, 1.5 ounces of green crème de menthe.

Water in the early morning or the late evening when the sun is not shining directly on the plant. But the best time is early morning because then they get a chance to dry out before night falls and they won't develop as much fungus.

In actuality, when it's on the convection setting, it really is a tiny oven. Convection cooking uses a heating element to heat the air inside the oven. A small fan gently circulates the air around the food. This method of cooking creates golden brown exteriors with moist interiors. Before we get started actually baking these cookies, there is three important things that I want to mention about convection ovens. One, when using the convection setting, always use the shelf provided to ensure proper air flow around your food. Two, when choosing your cookware, follow the same rules that you would with a regular oven, meaning you can use metal and heat-resistant glass like Pyrex, but never use anything containing paper or wood, even if it says it's microwavable safe. And three, when using the convection oven for baked goods, always reduce your recommended temperature by 25 degrees. So, let's get started. For cookies, your oven should be preheated.

It is absolutely a phenomenal piece of engineering. It feels extremely solid. You know, it's not as light as I thought it would be. At four and a half pounds, it does still have a bit of heft to it, but it feels like an incredibly solid machine. The hinge on it is very very sturdy. The the way that the lid magnetically closes to the body, like it did in the previous gen MacBook Pro, it just feels very, very nice. One thing I noticed is that the display itself is very thin. It's just mind-blowing how they were able to cram these four-to-one pixel ratios in a display and get it thinner than a display with a quarter of that resolution.

It's underneath the rear seat. Simply insert the key down here, turn it left and you can pop off this upper section. This is the aftermarket rear cowl, of course. You do have, I do have the stock seat for it as well. And then you can see I have just enough space in here for all my insurance registration things and one tool.

So they're going to have to figure that out. I think Bob Arum's gonna have to come in with his hat in his hand a little bit more if he's going to do a deal with Dana White. I think he's starting to learn and realize that. But, I think that Bob brings something to the table here. I think that Terence Crawford is a real guy with real skills that's got a real fan base. I mean, there's something interesting there. Look, I'm not bullish on the fight that this is going to happen. That's not at all my message here. But you and I talking as two guys, I think it's a little fun. And I think if we hear more about Terence's wrestling background, I'll be more interested in it. I only heard that because people have said it. I'm a long-time wrestler, it's a small community. I've never seen this guy at a tournament, I've never seen this guy in a practice room. They're claiming that he has a wrestling background. But if he's got the courage to step into the Octagon with Conor McGregor, I'm gonna take him at his word.\" The second man responds: \"Yeah, and I wonder if Terence is a big enough name, right? Like, I know he's a big name in the world of boxing. I don't know if he's, you know, a name like Floyd. I think it's fair, very fair to say that he's not a name like Floyd, but Conor is, you know, up there with Floyd as far as some of the, you know, the most famous athletes in the world. I don't know if Terence is out there. So, like right now, would you say who's a more popular person in the sports world, Terence Crawford or say Jorge Masvidal, or say Khabib Nurmagomedov? Like, the whole point of doing this is to try to up your stock, right?\" A slapping sound is heard. He continues, \"But I would argue that Khabib and Jorge are actually bigger names right now in the sports world than Terence Crawford. Am I crazy?\" The first man replies, \"No, you're correct on that. I think you make a very fair point. There would be some work that had to be done. Look, when you drop Floyd and and Conor in somebody's lap, the job is kind of done. With Terence, it's going to take a little bit of work and a little bit of storytelling.\" The second man says, \"Yeah, and he's not much of a showman, he doesn't sell himself, so, I don't know. I don't think it happens, but the two-fight thing is kind of interesting.\" A swooshing sound is followed by a click. A different man speaks: \"Thanks for watching ESPN on YouTube.

This was a candle that I bought at a hardware store, and I peeled the wax off of it. The thing costs $12. It runs off of two C batteries. And when you turn it on, it kind of flickers, but the neat thing about it, it doesn't put off any heat. It's completely safe in a closed environment. What you want to do is you put your marbles, maybe in layers, whatever design you want to use, but when you get up to the candle, you want to put clear marbles around it. The further down, the more glow you'll have. Now this particular candle, which I must say was made in China, like everything else, will last over 200 hours. So when it runs out, you just dump everything out, put in new batteries, and decide on a new pattern for your nightlight. I'll go ahead and put it all together now and let you see it. Here it is with the lights in the room on. You can purchase little bags of these half marbles at Walmart for like a dollar eighty-eight a bag, get a whole bunch of them. This lasts a long time, like I said, and but the candle itself cost me about $12, so that's the biggest expense.

That not all of the male-female disparity in tech may be the result of sexism. That at least some of it may be attributed to men and women having different goals for their careers and their lives. To cite just two examples, in the study Women, Careers, and Work-Life Preferences, published in the British Journal of Guidance and Counseling, the study's authors conclude that women, across populations, tend to look for more work-life balance while men tend to have a higher drive for status. And according to a study by Cal State Fullerton psychologist Richard Lippa, men, on average, tend to be more interested in things, while women tend to be more interested in people. These findings have been replicated many times. They've actually been cited by other researchers as a cause for the gender gap in tech. In other words, I didn't make this stuff up. In fact, after my document came under attack, evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller said that its empirical claims were scientifically accurate. But Google disagreed. Like, really disagreed. First, the company's newly appointed VP of Diversity, Integrity, and Governance, Danielle Brown, posted a memo that said my report advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent a memo to all employees saying that I crossed the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes. This was, he added, not okay. Then he fired me.\" A subtle whoosh sound is heard. The speaker continues, \"By that point, much to my shock, my document had gone viral. News outlets were branding it an anti-diversity manifesto.\" The sound of a page turning is heard. \"But if they had read what I wrote, they could see for themselves that it was pro-diversity. I had suggested multiple ways that we could get more women into tech without resorting to counterproductive discrimination. Ironic, isn't it? The company that hires some of the smartest people in the world couldn't handle a well-reasoned, scientific discussion. But my firing pales in comparison to the larger issue. Will Google force upon its users the same politically correct views that it forces upon its employees? The evidence is disturbing. Google already manipulates its products to fit a certain viewpoint. Just one example: YouTube, Google's video platform, restricts access to dozens of PragerU videos, along with videos made by other influential moderates and conservatives. Yes, Google is a business and can set its own policies. But for its billions of users, Google is their main gateway to information, the lens through which they view the world.\" The sound of car horns is heard. \"This makes Google, in some ways, more powerful than even the government. And that means Google has a special responsibility to, well, simply follow its own motto: Don't be evil. I'm James Damore for Prager University.\" The music then changes to a gentle, uplifting piano melody as he continues, \"Thank you for watching this video. To support PragerU and ensure millions of people watch this video and others like it, please consider making a tax-deductible donation.\""

Now there's an atmospheric river, a relatively warm tropical storm over Northern California today. It's over Central California, kind of the Fresno area tomorrow, sagging down into our area on Wednesday. But as it comes on through, we have to battle our infamous rain shadow. You see a lot of evaporation here for the valley. And because this is a warm storm, it's a good soaking rain for the mountains but not a lot of snow. Here on the valley floor, we're talking about 69 today. That's a couple degrees above average, way higher than that 49 we had one day last week, which was the coldest high set for that date in record after winter weather had come barreling through. So we'll call it a 6% chance of rain here on the valley floor on Wednesday. Some computer models are saying a few hundredths of an inch, some are saying a tenth or two. Remember, this is a very wet storm, but can it overcome these relatively warm temperatures and the evaporation rate? That's the big question. As we head into Friday, we'll be dry that day with a little bit of cooler, fresher air coming onshore. And then we're right back up to those mid-60s this weekend with yet another chance of rain Saturday into Sunday.\" Papers rustle. A man then says, \"Alright, very good.

Unlike most woody Australian plants, wattles do not usually respond well to heavy pruning. To be on the safe side, it's a good rule of thumb not to cut into wood any thicker than a pencil. But if they do get a bit leggy, you might want to give them a light trim. But make sure that you wear gloves and long sleeves because the prickly foliage can sometimes cause allergic reactions to your skin. The spiky foliage of prickly Moses provides the perfect option for creating protection for our small birds. But growing a bird-friendly garden is more than just putting in one or two plants. To provide the complete habitat for a whole range of birds, we need layers, from ground covers to small and medium shrubs, and even trees if you've got the space.

Of course, they're not going to have survived all those years completely untouched. They would have to evolve with the times and of course the platform in question. So, yeah, some rather interesting stuff. And it obviously wouldn't have been completely free. It probably would have been like a subscription-based thing or something like that. It wouldn't have been what it was if they had gone through this, which is of course pay your $300 or whatever upfront and that's your lot. It would have been something else. They would have found another method of monetization. I don't know if subscription could really work for a console. I don't really know. But obviously, that's not something we've ever seen really. No company has ever done that and I don't think they ever will, to be completely honest with you, as consoles are just getting more and more expensive to make. And of course, they would like to get the money flowing back into the company from the sales of those consoles as soon as possible. So, I don't think this is an idea we'll ever see come back, but it's still interesting to see exactly how these ideas are coming into play now with Windows and of course what they were considering for the company."

And I also had half a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract in with my maple syrup. So I'm going to go ahead and just stir this together until the mixture is completely smooth. Get your arm muscles in there. Stir it up. And you kind of want to mix it to the point where it starts to stiffen up a little bit.

And I've got three tablespoons, no actually four tablespoons of shredded coconut and that's going in as well. And then I'm going to stir that all together until it's evenly combined. Then I'm going to press my dough into a plastic wrap lined small container that's about, I don't know, two and a half to three inches squared. So you can find whatever little pan you like to have the thickness that you want. And I'm going to go ahead and spoon my mixture right in. It's a little bit sticky, but after we chill it, it's going to firm up nicely. So it is important to kind of keep mixing until the mixture becomes quite firm, a little bit stiff. And once your mixture has been pressed, slip this into the freezer or into the fridge until it's firm. So if you want the chilling to be a little bit faster, stick it into the freezer. I recommend keeping it in the fridge for at least six hours before pulling it out and chopping it into squares that are just like this.
